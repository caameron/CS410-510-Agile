Run server in command line: python server.py
Run client in command line: python client.py username password

Run the server first, then other clients can connect. Right now the default host ip is local host.
Server will continue to run forever while clients connect. 

When server first connects it will make ServerFiles on desktop.
When clients connect, a ClientFiles directory will be made on desktop.
These two directories are the primary means of transfer between files.

When client successfully connects, will be prompted with choosing a command.
